# How Cold Stress effects on the Locomotion of Crickets

The primary aim of this study is to determine if cold stress
has the hypothesized detrimental effect on the four locomotion
metrics that were measured (number of events, total distance, 
total time in motion, and total average speed) for fast events
and for slow events. Another aim is an exploration of a 
hypothesized acclimation period, where a cricket moves more 
at the beginning of the 10 minutes, and moves less later on, 
as it has already explored its surroundings.
